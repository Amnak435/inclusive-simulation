Inclusive Simulation

Accessibility Simulation Platform

By InVision — Amnaaman.org

Inclusive Simulation is an interactive accessibility simulation built to help developers, designers, and organizations understand the real-world challenges faced by people with disabilities. The platform simulates visual, auditory, and mobility impairments to promote inclusive design practices.


🎯 Purpose

Many digital products are not designed with accessibility in mind.
Inclusive Simulation helps teams experience barriers firsthand so they can build more inclusive solutions.



🧩 What This Simulation Demonstrates
	•	👁️ Visual impairments (blurred vision, color blindness, low vision)
	•	🔇 Hearing impairments (muted audio, distorted speech)
	•	🦽 Mobility challenges (limited cursor movement, delayed response)
	•	🧠 Cognitive overload (distractions, delayed UI feedback)



⚙️ Built With
	•	⚛️ React
	•	⚡ Vite
	•	🎨 CSS / Tailwind (optional)
	•	♿ Accessibility APIs & simulation logic



🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inclusive-simulation.git
cd inclusive-simulation

2️⃣ Install dependencies

npm install

3️⃣ Run the development server

npm run dev

App will run at:

http://localhost:5173

🧪 Example Simulations

👁️ Blur Vision Simulation

Simulates cataracts or low vision by applying blur filters.

🎨 Color Blind Mode

Preview designs as seen by users with color vision deficiencies.

🦽 Motor Delay Mode

Adds delay to click and keyboard interactions.

🌟 Why This Matters

Over 1 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability.
Inclusive design ensures technology works for everyone — not just the majority.


🧭 Roadmap
